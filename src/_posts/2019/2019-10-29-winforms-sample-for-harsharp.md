[Ajay Tandon](https://github.com/AJ1000) sent me a WinForms sample that he made using HarSharp.

The HTTP Archive (HAR) format as defined in the W3C Specification is an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads.

[HarSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/harsharp) is a small and easy-to-use library to parse HAR files to .NET objects that I created some years ago for .NET Framework, today I released the version 2.0.0 with support to .NET Core / .NET Standard.
