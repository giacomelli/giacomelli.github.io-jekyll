* **SIGGRAPH 2019** is taking place in Los Angeles, between July 28 and August 1. Unity has made a page where you can see the Unity's  presentations calendar ([Unity at SIGGRAPH 2019](https://unity.com/events/siggraph-2019)). 

* **Kin** is a currency for the digital world that just now caught my attention. There is an SDK for Unity. They are posing a challenge for Unity developers, the deadline is December 30, 2019. I'm curious which Unity games you are already using? ([Kin Gaming Challenge](https://kin.org/developers/unityapply/gaming-challenge/)).
> Kin enables the free and instant transfer of value between users, no matter how small the amount. This lets users give something more meaningful than a like, making your app even more fun and engaging.

* **Lasse Jon Fuglsang Pedersen and Robert Cupisz** in the making of The Heretic, a real-time short film made with Unity. ([Lasse Jon Fuglsang Pedersen, Robert Cupisz - Making of The Heretic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H9Jo2qjJXs)).
