* **Dilmer Valecillos** posted a video on augmented reality while implementing a dragging feature with ray-casting ([AR Foundation with Unity3d and Adding Dragging Functionality with AR Raycast and Physics Raycast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBftG-gXUE8)).

* **Felipe Lira** created a GitHub repository with a bare bones Scriptable Render Pipeline. ([HelloSRP](https://github.com/phi-lira/HelloSRP)).
> Bare Bones Scriptable Render Pipeline. Use it as a base to create your own.

* **Sebastian Lague** made some updates to his path creation tool ([Bézier Path Creator](https://github.com/SebLague/Path-Creator)).
> An intuitive and lightweight editor for quickly creating smooth paths in the editor.
You can easily make objects move along these paths, or use them as a guide for spawning objects and generating meshes.

* **Unity**, started its annual survey asking for community feedback ([survey](https://on.unity.com/2xdSRmX)).

* **Sykoo** published a YouTube video showing what he learned after making more than 100 game levels ([What I Learned after Making 100+ GAME LEVELS! (Unity Level Design)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPimiBP8d6o)).

* **Nichole Wong** wrote about the new `Unity Learn Premium` ([Introducing Unity Learn Premium: Get direct guidance from experts](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/06/27/introducing-unity-learn-premium/)).

* **Eduardo Oriz and Alitt Khaliq** made a post showing the behind the scenes and dive further into the creative process behind Buried Memories Volume 2: Serekh ([The creative process behind Serekh](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/06/28/the-creative-process-behind-serekh/)).

The development of Serekh was a combined effort by Edvige Faini, the Concept Artist, and the Unity Icon Collective. Some of the most significant challenges on this project were conceptual rather than technical.


* **Sykoo** again, with a video on tips, tricks, and list of features in Unity for making 2D games ([How to make 2D Games with Unity 2019!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MuWAydTjY0)).
