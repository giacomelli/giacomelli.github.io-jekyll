When I was reading about the [Sprite Mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteMask.html) on Unity Manual, I questioned my self `"How long does it take to create a flashlight effect using the Sprite Mask?"`.

The answer is: `less than 2 minutes`. 

You can check this by watching the video tutorial that I made showing how to add the a flashlight effect to the [Unity 2D Roguelike sample project](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/2d-roguelike-29825):
