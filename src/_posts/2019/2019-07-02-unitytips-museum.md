I [recently](https://twitter.com/ogiacomelli/status/1144379461317648384) started studying [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client) and last weekend I created this simple app that I called: `#unitytips Museum`, a collection of best #unitytips.

# The #unitytips collection
Every week all #unitytips retweeted by [@unity3d](https://twitter.com/unity3d) will be included to the collection.

If you know a really good #unitytips (at least 50 retweets) that should be added to the collection, please follow one of options above:

* Contact me on Twitter [@ogiacomelli](https://twitter.com/ogiacomelli).
* [Fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/giacomelli/unitytips-museum), add the #unitytips to the wwwroot/data/tips.json file and create a pull-request.

# About Blazor
> Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly. Because it's real .NET running on WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application.

In a future post I will discuss what I learned about Blazor while developing the #unitytips Museum, but I can give a spoiler: I really liked it!
