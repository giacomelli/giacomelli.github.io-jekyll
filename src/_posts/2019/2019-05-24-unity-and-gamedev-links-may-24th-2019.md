* **Kristin Stock** post a video about how she is [procedurally generating cities using Subdivsion in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBDrH3lg4YY).

* **Dave Hunt and Yang-Hai Eakes** made an [introduction for the Animation Rigging preview package for Unity 2019.1](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/14/introducing-the-animation-rigging-preview-package-for-unity-2019-1/).
> Set up procedural motion on animated skeletons at runtime. You can use a set of predefined animation constraints to manually build a control rig hierarchy for a character or develop your own custom constraints in C#.

* **Alexander Ameye** launch a [site with many Unity tutorials](https://alexanderameye.github.io/), like `Water 1: Tessellated Plane` and `Toon Shading`.

* **Shahriar Shahrabi** made a post showing how use [deformation matrices to achieve the `Inception effect`](https://medium.com/realities-io/making-the-inception-effect-in-unity-3d-with-few-lines-of-code-fb9667d4786f).
> Have you ever wondered how your brain would react if you bend the space around you in VR? Or change the field of view and do a vertigo? Well I did, so I started writing a series of shaders which deformed the space around me, using matrices and ended up with an Inception looking effect.

* **Steve Cavanagh and Lyndon Homewood** wrote a post about the [Unity Profile Analyzer (preview)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/13/introducing-the-profile-analyzer/).
> Have you ever needed to compare the difference in performance between two versions of your project? See the impact of an asset or code change, optimization work, settings change or Unity version upgrade? 

* **Unity 2019.2 beta** released an [experimental 2D Renderer in LWRP](https://forum.unity.com/threads/experimental-2d-renderer-in-lwrp.683623) with 2D lights, Lit and Unlit Sprite Masternode in Shader Graph, and Pixel Perfect Camera.

* **Julien Blais** wrote about a post about [new feature Signals](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/21/how-to-use-timeline-signals) added to Timeline in Unity 2019.1.
> Weâ€™ve built Signals to establish a communication channel between Timeline and outside systems. But what does that mean? Why did we decide on this approach?
