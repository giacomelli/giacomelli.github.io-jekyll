* **Nick Davis** wrote a post about how Unity recently teamed up with Autodesk and Texel Logic to create a mixed-reality experience to illustrate and understand the complex nature of airflow passing over and around an IndyCar ([Simulating high-speed IndyCars in AR](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/24/simulating-high-speed-indycars-in-ar/)).

* **Sykoo**, online evangelist for Unity, published a video showing his techniques during the level design process ([How I made a Village in Unity in 1 Hour!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKzX-wS4_so)).

* **Joyce[MinionsArt]** released another shader tutorial on Twitter ([Using particle lifetime to create a fire system](https://twitter.com/minionsart/status/1132593681452683264)).


* **Keen Claassen** celebrated the enter of `Motion Matching for Unity` on Asset Store ([Motion Matching for Unity (MxM) - Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiWvExOyBgQ)).

* **Chandra Foxglove** introduced the Terrain Tools package (preview) for Unity 2019.1 ([Speed up your work with the new Terrain Tools Package](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/28/speed-up-your-work-with-the-new-terrain-tools-package)).
> This package contains over 15 new sculpting tools, as well as a utility toolbox to streamline terrain workflow.

* **The Making of The Heretic: Digital Humans and VFX Characters** is available through a [Google Docs presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aiBXsNu-D9ZfpBNqcs08w7ToNJ2e7jgyoyfNUXSCWW8/edit#slide=id.g552bb7139f_6_1117).
> Now the HD Render Pipeline and Post Processing are quite solid, and we were able to put much more effort into building on top of that foundation. Among other things, we put some effort into human faces and vfx-heavy characters.


* The evangelist **Keijiro Takahashi** released a GitHub repository with an example that shows how to connect RealSense depth camera to Unity VFX Graph ([Rsvfx](https://github.com/keijiro/Rsvfx)).
