* **Alexander Ameye** made a tutorial about edge detection shaders with Shader Graph and how to use some Lightweight Rendering Pipeline customization to generate DepthNormals ([Edge Detection Shader](https://alexanderameye.github.io/edgedetection)).

* **Cyan** made a blog post about Render Textures and how to read them  in a C# script ([Render Textures](https://cyangamedev.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/render-textures/)).
> Render Textures are stored and handled on the GPU, which means we can’t access the data from them in a C# script which runs on the CPU – and you shouldn’t really need to for most effects. However, I wanted my player to be able to interact with water which was based on a Render Texture and only spawn particles if the player was in the water, along with some other effects. 

* **Frank Manley** wrote about the Unity Hackweek 2019 ([Unity Hackweek 2019: Tackling hard problems, building team skills](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/08/unity-hackweek-2019-tackling-hard-problems-building-team-skills)).
> What happens when you put 700+ people from Unity and our ecosystem in a secluded location once a year and tell them to solve hard tech, coding, and process problems? Their instructions? Unleash your creativity, collaborate like crazy, and embrace diverse perspectives.

* **Tracy Joseph and Brittany Edmond,** wrote a blog post about their experience on Cannes Lions 2019 ([Cannes Lions 2019: Celebrating creativity, innovation & storytelling](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/09/cannes-lions-2019-celebrating-creativity-innovation-storytelling)).
>This year at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Unity showed up as the leading real-time 3D creation platform.

* **Garrexus** made a breakdown on the Screen space Cosmic shader ([Screen space Cosmic shader breakdown (Unity/ASE, Shaders/Textures included)](https://realtimevfx.com/t/screen-space-cosmic-shader-breakdown-unity-ase-shaders-textures-included/9753)).

* **Alexander Ameye** again, now with a tutorial about collision effect ([Collision Effect](https://alexanderameye.github.io/collision.html)).

* **Tenzin W. and Eduardo Oriz,** wrote about the results of the latest Asset Store challenge ([The Winners! Inside the Vault: 3D Environment Art Contest](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/11/the-winners-inside-the-vault-3d-environment-art-contest)).
> A number of judges evaluated all of the impressive submissions to pick the winners of the latest Asset Store challenge: Use Substance Painter to texture stunning assets that expand the futuristic world of Buried Memories: Yggdrasil.

* **Anis Benyoub** made a speech about ray tracing hardware acceleration ([Anis Benyoub - Leveraging Ray Tracing Hardware Acceleration In The Unity Game Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbuvrAdNtmQ)).
> Ray tracing hardware acceleration (RTX) is a newly available feature that allows graphics developers to increase their image quality. While solving complex problems, properly integrating this new set of APIs (DXR and Vulkan ray tracing) in a game engine is tricky, especially so when the engine supports anything from mobile to virtual production. 

* **Brackeys** published a video about gamepad input ([CONTROLLER INPUT in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3S73MaDP8)).

* **Sykoo** made a video showing how to make terrains ([How to make Terrains with Unity 2019! (Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vvwjfp-hg8)).
