After some months of hard work I finally released the Buildron mods support.

This [Buildron 2.0.0-RC1](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1) represents a great change in Buildron code structure, because we built a mods support that allow any developer add his own mods to Buildron.

Hope to see you building some mods to Buildron. We're curious about what crazy mods ideas you could have ;).

We really appreciate your opinion about the mods support, [documentation](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/wiki/Mods-introduction), [tutorial](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/wiki/Mods-tutorial-creating-a-mod) and [ModSdk](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/wiki/Mods-ModSdk). Please, get in touch at [@ogiacomelli](http://twitter.com/ogiacomelli).
