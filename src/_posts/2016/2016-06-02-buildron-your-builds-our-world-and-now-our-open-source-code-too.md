[Buildron](http://github.com/skahal/buildron) is a build radiator to continuous integration server like TeamCity, Jenkins and Hudson.

We've built it as a [Skahal's](http://skahal.com) product and now we decide to **open source it: [http://github.com/skahal/buildron](http://github.com/skahal/buildron)**.

You can run it on Windows, OSX and Linux: [https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/releases](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/releases)

There is a remote control app too (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS and Android), where you can sort and filter builds, among other things: [https://github.com/skahal/Buildron-rc/releases](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron-rc/releases)

Give it a try:
