After some months to test the [v2.0.0-RC1](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1) we are releasing the final version of [Buildron](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/) mods support with this [2.0.0 version](https://github.com/skahal/Buildron/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

Mods supports represents a great change in Buildron code structure, because we built a mods support that allow any developer add his own mods to Buildron.
