[Buildron](https://github.com/skahal/buildron) is a build radiator to help software development teams to see the current status of their continous integration server and [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the omnipresent communication app for almost every developer in the world.
 

For these reasons, I made a mod called [Buildron.SlackBotMod](https://github.com/giacomelli/Buildron.SlackBotMod) that let you interact with Buildron through the Slack.

## Features
Currently Buildron SlackBotMod has the follow features:

### Status changed notifications
Your team can be notified by Buildron about builds status changed. In the mod preferences you can choose what status you want to receive notifications (running|succes|failed).
