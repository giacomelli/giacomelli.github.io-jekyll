I published on Google Play the **GeneticSharp Unity3d Samples**.

In this app you can see GeneticSharp running on Unity3d in three different samples:


## Car2D
Based on famous BoxCar2D, this sample uses a genetic algorithm to create car designs to overcome road challenges, like gaps, hills, and obstacles.

## TSP
The classic TSP sample, but in this, we can change the cities positions while the genetic algorithm is running and see how it finds the best route.

This sample inspired this post [TSP with GeneticSharp and Unity3D](http://diegogiacomelli.com.br/tsp-with-GeneticSharp-and-Unity3d/).

## Wall builder
This sample tries to build a higher wall using random initial bricks positions.
