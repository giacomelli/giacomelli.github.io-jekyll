Some years ago I coded a CHIP-8 emulator in C# just for fun, that emulator was hibernating in a private repository that I never released. Some days ago I started to working on it again with the idea to release it running on Blazor and as a Unity asset where any game developer could drag its prefabs as easter eggs directly to their games.

In this post, I will talk about how I put a **CHIP-8 emulator to run inside the Unity Editor Inspector Window**.

To help to understand everything in this post I recommend you read the previous [ARC-8 devlog posts](/tags/arc8-devlog), in special the [last one](/arc-8-devlog-3).

{% note The source code is not yet published on GitHub, I will notify in this series of posts about ARC-8 devlog and on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogiacomelli) too when this happens. %}

## Introduction
Just for fun, I wanted to run the graphics of the emulator inside the Unity Editor Inspector Window. Maybe, you can ask "why?", well there is an inside joke among Unity developers where we try to play not expected things inside the inspector window, as you can see in the links below:

## Chip8LoaderEditor.cs
This is a simplified version of the [Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.html) script for [Chip8Loader](/arc-8-devlog-3).

#### StartEmulator and StopEmulator methods
In the method `StartEmulator` we start the emulation inside the Inspector Window.
After starting the emulator by calling the `Run` method of `Chip8Loader` passing our local `EditorChip8Input` to override the emulator input to always use the keyboard.
We use the `EditorCoroutineUtility.StartCoroutine` method from the [Editor Coroutines package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.editorcoroutines@0.0/manual/index.html) to start two coroutines for update and render emulator inside the editor.

The `StopEmulator` stops the emulation inside the Inspector Window using the `EditorCoroutineUtility.StopCoroutine`.

#### UpdateEmulator and RenderEmulator methods
In the method `UpdateEmulator` we call [LateUpdate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.LateUpdate.html) from `Chip8Loader` to run a emulation cycle.

The `RenderEmulator` calls the [Repaint](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.Repaint.html) from Editor to redraw the inspector using the [OnInspectorGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.OnInspectorGUI.html).

#### OnInspectorGUI method
When the emulation is not running this method just draws the `Chip8Loader` inspector using the [DrawDefaultInspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.DrawDefaultInspector.html).

When we click on the button `Test emulator` on the inspector, the emulation is activated and the emulation will be rendered on the inspector.

When we use the `GUI.BeginClip` everything that we draw using the [GL (Low-level graphics library)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GL.html) will be rendered inside the area passed as an argument to BeginClip. This is why we call `Graphic.Render` between the BeginClip and EndClip.

In the last step, we read the input using `input.ReadKeys`.

## Next step

In the next [ARC-8 devlog](/tags/arc8-devlog) post I will probably talk about the release of the ARC-8 as an open-source project.

If you have any doubts about what I talk about above or any tip about the CHIP-8 emulator (or Unity) and you like to share it, please let me know in the comments section below.
