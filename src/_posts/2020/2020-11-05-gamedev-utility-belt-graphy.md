I decided to start a [series of posts](/tags/gamedev-utility-belt/) about some game development resources that are part of my gamedev utility belt and that helps me on my game projects.

For this second post, the chosen one is the **[Graphy](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy)** by [MartÃ­n Pane](https://twitter.com/martinTayx) that I used in a lot of my Unity projects.

## Introduction
Graphy is:
> a feature packed FPS Counter, stats monitor and debugger

My main use for it was to monitor the FPS of my mobile games, but Graphy has many other features:

> With this tool you will be able to visualize and catch when your game has some unexpected hiccup or stutter, and act accordingly!
> 
> The debugger allows you to set one or more conditions, that if met will have the consequences you desire, such as taking a screenshot, pausing the editor, printing a message to the console and more! Even call a method from your own code if you want!

## Installation
You can follow the instructions on the plugin GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy#installation) to install it:

* Using the OpenUPM
* Via Package Manager 

## Usage
Just drag the `[Graphy]` prefab from folder `Assets/Taxy/Graphy - Ultimate Stats Monitor` to your scene and Play the scene to see it in action.
