## Cute, but challenging!

Don't let the cute look or super fun animations fool you, Puzzimals is a cube-matching game challenging you to match identical tiles in 100 levels of thought-provoking puzzles in a world map.

Packed with features and creative puzzles you can combine cubes of ice, wild cards, bombs and so much more!

Each level unlocks and increases in difficulty and offers an almost infinite number of combos.

Fans of casual puzzle games will enjoy the crisp, colorful graphics featuring cute animals and the compelling music offers great relaxation.
