I decided to start a [series of posts](/tags/gamedev-utility-belt/) about some game development resources that are part of my gamedev utility belt and that helps me on my game projects.

For this first post the choose one is the **[Unity Native Share Plugin](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare)** by [SÃ¼leyman Yasir KULA](https://twitter.com/yasirkula) that I used on my latest mobile game [Puzzimals](http://diegogiacomelli.com.br/games/puzzimals).

## Introduction
Unity Native Share Plugin is:
> A Unity plugin to natively share files (images, videos, documents, etc.) and/or plain text on Android & iOS.

When you use this plugin on the Android and iOS project you will be able to invoke the native share of the target operating system.
For example, here is the result when I used it on Android:

## Installation
You can follow the instructions on the plugin GitHub repository: [https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare#installation) to install it:

* Using .unitypackage
* Cloning the repository
* Via Asset Store
* Via Package Manager 
* Using the OpenUPM

## Usage
The plugin is quite simple to be used, there is an [example code on its repository](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare#example-code) that show how you can use it with few lines of code.

Some time ago I made the gist below that uses the `Unity Native Share Plugin` to add a social share component to any game object:
