Some years ago I coded a CHIP-8 emulator in C# just for fun, that emulator was hibernating in a private repository that I never released. Some days ago I started to working on it again with the idea to release it running on Blazor and as a Unity asset where any game developer could drag its prefabs as easter eggs directly to their games.

In this post, I will talk about **how I implemented the graphics, sound, input, and log systems for Unity 3D**.

You can read the others [ARC-8's devlog posts](/tags/arc8-devlog).

{% note The source code is not yet published on GitHub, I will notify in this series of posts about ARC-8 devlog and on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogiacomelli) too when this happens. %}

## Introduction
If you was out of planet in the last decade, maybe you don't know what is [Unity](https://unity.com): Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed in C++, but the games made on it are developing using .NET and C#.

> Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction.

> In the previous version Unity only supported a subset of .NET Framework (4.x), but nowadays it's supporting .NET Standard 2.0.

This is why we can use our `ARC-8 Core`, mentioned in the the [first devlog](/arc-8-devlog-1), because it is a `.NET Standard class library` and can run directly on Unity.

## Online demo
You can test and play the CHIP-8's games directly on your browser with our online demo: [ARC-8 Unity Online Demo](/apps/unity-arc-8).

## Systems interfaces implementations
{% icon component.png %}
The system interfaces `IGraphic`, `ISound`, `IInput`, and `ILog` will be implemented as [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html).

> The MonoBehaviour class is the base class from which every Unity script derives, by default. TPovides the framework which allows you to attach your script to a GameObject in the editor, as well as providing hooks into useful Events such as Start and Update.

## Chip8Graphic.cs MonoBehaviour (IGraphic)
{% icon graphic.png %}
This the `IGraphic` implementation.
{% gist 560a0d0eda7762fc73ad0aa84f3d3ebb Chip8Graphic.cs %}

#### OnAfterRenderAsync method
In the method `OnAfterRenderAsync` we verify if it's the component's first render, then we call a JS method that will initialize a JS helper for `Chip8Graphic.razor` that will return the size of the canvas to C# code, then we use this information to scale our 64 x 32 CHIP-8's display.

> OnAfterRenderAsync and OnAfterRender are called after a component has finished rendering. Element and component references are populated at this point. Use this stage to perform additional initialization steps using the rendered content, such as activating third-party JavaScript libraries that operate on the rendered DOM elements.

#### Draw method
This is one of the two methods needed to be implemented of `IGraphic` interface. We received the array (64x32) of bytes representing the current state of CHIP-8 graphics and just update our local array variable `_gfx`.

#### RenderAsync method
The method `RenderAsync` will be called by the `Chip8Loader` component during the [Game Loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html).

This method is used to draw the state of CHIP-8 graphics (_gfx array) to the HTML page. 
We use a second array called `_buffer` to implement a [Double Buffer](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html) and reduce the `screen flickering`. 
{% note A byte with value 1 should be drawn (foreground color) and a byte with value 0 should not be drawn (background color). %}

#### Invalidate method
This is the second of the two methods needed to be implemented of `IGraphic` interface, but as we implemented a Double Buffer, this method does not need to perform any operation.

#### Resize method
Called by the JS side every time that the user resizes the browser window.

#### ClearCanvasAsync method
We use this one to invalidate our `_buffer` and reset the canvas to the background color.

## Chip8Sound.cs MonoBehaviour (ISound)
{% icon sound.png %}
This is `ISound` implementation.

{% gist 560a0d0eda7762fc73ad0aa84f3d3ebb Chip8Sound.cs %}

#### OnInitialized method
We just use the information from `NavigationManager` to set the audio file we want to play.

#### Play method
This is the only method we need to implement of `ISound` interface and it just calls a JS method that will get the `audio` tag on the component, set the `AudioSource`, then load, and play it.

## KeyboardChip8Input.cs MonoBehaviour (IInput)
{% icon joystick.png %}
This is the `IInput` implementation.

{% gist 560a0d0eda7762fc73ad0aa84f3d3ebb KeyboardChip8Input.cs %}

#### Key mapping
First we create the dictionary `_map` to map the real keyboard keys to CHIP-8 keypad keys.
The second dictionary we create is `_keyDown`. It will be used to map what keys the player is pressing.

#### OnAfterRenderAsync method
We call the JS method `chip8Input.init` that will add two event listeners, one for `keydown` and the other for `keyup` that will call the C# methods `HandleKeyDown` and `HandleKeyUp`.

#### UpdateKeys method
The only method we need to implement for `IInput` interface. 
In this method, we set to `1` the CHIP-8's keypad keys that were pressed by the player.

#### HandleKeyDown and HandleKeyUp methods
This method is responsible to set the `_keyDown` dictionary by the keyboard keys that the player pressed.

## Chip8Log.cs MonoBehaviour (ILog)
{% icon logging.png %}
This is the `ILog` implementation.

### C# side
{% gist 560a0d0eda7762fc73ad0aa84f3d3ebb Chip8Log.cs %}

#### Debug and Error methods
The two methods implemented for `ILog` interface use the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>` to send log messages to the browser console.

## Chip8Loader.cs
{% icon package.png %}
This is the component responsible to load all systems (IGraphic, ISound, IInput, and ILog), initialize the `Chip8` class emulator,  load the ROM and perform the game loop.

{% gist 560a0d0eda7762fc73ad0aa84f3d3ebb Chip8Loader.cs %}

#### OnAfterRenderAsync method
Initializes the emulator with the systems, then calls the JS `chip8Loader.init` function that will use the browser [window.requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) to call the C# method `RunCycle`.

> The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. 

#### RunCycle method
This method is called by the JS  (`window.requestAnimationFrame`).
We implement a [Game Loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) and in the end, call the `Chip8Graphic.RenderAsync`.

## Next step
{% icon conclusion.png %}
In the next [ARC-8 devlog](/tags/arc8-devlog) I will talk about the ARC-8's implementation on Unity3D.

If you have any doubts about what I talk about above or any tip about the CHIP-8 emulator (or Blazor) and you like to share it, please let me know in the comments section below.
