Last weekend I participated in **Kenney Jam 2020** (my first game jam).
The experience was really good, when you have so strong boundaries to make a game, in this case, **48 hours and just use assets from [Kenney](http://Kenney.nl/assets)**, you need to turn your way of think and expectations to a very specific and clear objective: release a fun and playable game the target just the core mechanics.

# The theme
The theme for this game jam was **"Cursed"**.
I took some time thinking about what game I would like to play and develop with such a theme, then I remembered how much I loved to play Lemmings and how those little ones were cursed to live in the small world where some of them should sacrifice for the others.

With this in mind, I started developing the game and things happened very well and I delivered my entry right on time. I had the finished version some hours before, but I took some time to review it.

The final result is **a simple game that takes the Lemmings core mechanic and adds some twist**: in Curseings, there are two kinds of walkers: the human and the cursed and you need to take each kind to different portals. If a cursed touch a human, that human becomes a cursed one too. The gamer will need to use this new mechanic to overcome some levels, sometimes the player will need to avoid they touch each other, sometimes don't.

* Just drag a behavior from the toolbar over a correspond walker to change his behavior.
* The objective of each level is to help the expected number of people and cursed to reach each portal.
* When a cursed touches a person, the person morphs into a cursed.
* Drag an item from the toolbar over a person or cursed to change its behavior.
