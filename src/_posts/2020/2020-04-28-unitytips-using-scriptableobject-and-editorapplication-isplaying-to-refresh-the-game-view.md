You can use [EditorApplication.isPlaying](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-isPlaying.html) in your custom editor to update the game view when a [ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html) is updated and you need to restart the scene or do something more complex to see the result of ScriptableObject changed during the game's playing in the editor.
