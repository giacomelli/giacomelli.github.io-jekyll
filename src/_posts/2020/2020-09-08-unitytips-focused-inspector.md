Starting in Unity 2020.1, you can add a dedicated inspector window for a specific GameObject, Component, or Asset. 
It always displays the properties of the item you opened it for, even if you select something else in the editor.

To activate a Focused Inspector, select an item `(GameObject, Component, or Asset)` and in the context menu hit the `Properties...` menu item.
