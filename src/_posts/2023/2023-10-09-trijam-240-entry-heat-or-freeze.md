Last weekend I participated in **[Trijam #240](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-240)**.

> Trijam is a weekly game jam where your goal is to make something playable (and fun!) in just 3 hours.

## The theme
The theme for this game jam was **"Hot and cold"**.

> This was the second Trijam that I participated with purpose to test my small game engine: [Blazorame](/tags/blazorame).

This time I kinda like the game jam theme and I ended up created I simple shooter where you need to use the right gun against each kind of enemy.

The final result is: **Heat or Freeze**.

You are the ship's pilot and must survive waves of enemies as much as possible. 
You have two types of enemies: 

* Hot enemies: can be killed by the Cold Cannon (right)
* Cold enemies: can be killed by the Hot Cannon (left)

If you hit the enemy with the wrong cannon, the enemy will become stronger, greater, and faster.

## How to play
The game can be played directly on the browser here: [https://giacomelli.itch.io/heat-or-freeze](https://giacomelli.itch.io/heat-or-freeze).

* **A**: move the ship to left
* **D**: move the ship to right
* **LEFT ARROW**: fire the Hot Cannon
* **RIGHT ARROW**: fire the Cold Cannon
