Last weekend I participated in **[Trijam #239](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-239)**.

> Trijam is a weekly game jam where your goal is to make something playable (and fun!) in just 3 hours.

## The theme
The theme for this game jam was **"I need a medic!"**.

This was the second Trijam that I participated and it had a different purpose for me, because I wanted to test a small game engine that I I've been building from scratch, the idea of this game engine is to develop browser-playable games that look like games from Atari 2600 or Gameboy, for instance: it has a limited palette with just 4 colors like the classic Gameboy had. This game engine is entirely built in C# using Blazor. The games built with it are Blazor WebAssembly apps. 

The name of this small game engine is Blazorame.

As I didnâ€™t like much this Trijam theme, I ended up just creating a kinda of crossword game, even so This helped to understand the next steps needed to improve the Blazorame.

## How to play
The game can be played directly on the browser here: [https://giacomelli.itch.io/i-need-a-medic-crossword](https://giacomelli.itch.io/i-need-a-medic-crossword).

* **SPACE**: to use the current selected letter.
