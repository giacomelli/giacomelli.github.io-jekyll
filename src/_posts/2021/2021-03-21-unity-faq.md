# Physics 2D
## In rare cases some gameobjects can pass through 2D walls
If you are using the [Jobs Options](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Physics2DManager.html) to multithreading the execution of the 2D physics simulation, try to check the option `Use Consistency Sorting`:

> Enable this option if maintaining a consistent processing order becomes important to the simulation.
Executing simulation steps on multiple CPU threads produces separate batches of data. Processing these separate batches reduces determinism in processing order, although produces faster results.

# AI
## My NavMeshAgent pass through some paths, but not all of them
If you use the [Override Tile Size](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshBuildSettings-overrideTileSize.html) option, maybe you defined a too large value on it and some combinations of your "maze" are generating impossible paths to the NavMeshAgent. Try to uncheck this option or use lower values for the [ Tile Size](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshBuildSettings-tileSize.html).

## Use Agent.SetDestination too often makes the agents almost stop
If you use the Agent.SetDestination every frame there is a chance that your agents will follow slowly or almost stop following the target.
To better result and performance try to use the Agent.SetDestination with some interval or timeout. You can even use it if your agent previous destination is from some distance of the new target position.
