## Independent deployability
> Independent deployability is the idea that we can make a change to a microservie, deploy it, and release that change to our users, without having to deploy any other microservies.

## Modeled around a business domain
> By modeling services around business domains, we can make it easier to roll out new functionality and to recombine microservices ind different ways to deliver new functionality to our users. 


## Owing ther own state
> If a microservice wants to access data held by another microservice, it should go and ask that microservice for the data.
