Last weekend I participated in **[Trijam #154](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-154)**.

> Trijam is a weekly game jam where your goal is to make something playable (and fun!) in just 3 hours.

## The theme
The theme for this game jam was **"There is a twist...!"**.

When you have just 3 hours to make a game, even a simple one, you will need to thinking about the idea and plan a lot before start.
Besides, the theme "There is a twist...!" was a challenge one, at least to me. I took some time to realize a idea to develop.


The final result is **an Atari 2600 kind of game**: **Who Kills Who?**
{% screenshot who-kills-who.png %}
* There are 3 different elements in the screen: Red, Green and Blue.
* In the start Red kills Green, Green kills Blue and Blue kills Red. 
* The player can make a twist (here came the theme) and change Who Kills Who, making Blue kills Green, Green Kills Red and Red kills Blue.

## How to play
The game can be played directly on the browser here: [https://giacomelli.itch.io/who-kills-who](https://giacomelli.itch.io/who-kills-who).

* **ENTER**: to make a twist in Who Kills Who.
* **SPACE**: in the end screen to try again.
