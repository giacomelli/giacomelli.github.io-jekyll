{{ site.description }}.<br><br>
With over 22 years of professional programming experience, I am a senior .NET developer working for the last 18 years with .NET and C#. 
<br>
I write about C#, Unity 3D, game development and web development, and more.

Currently interested in anything that I can build with C# and mostly working on web projects during the day and game development projects with Unity 3D during the night.
