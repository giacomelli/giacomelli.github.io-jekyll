	<description>	
	This quick-time event game is based on the famous Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark scene where Indy needs to swap a bag with the Golden Idol to try not to activate the temple traps (we all know how it turns out).
	The game's objective is to hit any key at the exact moment that Indy should swap the items.
	You can try to collect as many Cursed Idols as you want, but if you miss the right moment you will lose them all and will be cursed.
