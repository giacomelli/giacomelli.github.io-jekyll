	<description>	
	You are the ship's pilot and must survive waves of enemies as much as possible. You have two types of enemies, 
	the hot enemies can be killed by the Cold Cannon (right) and cold enemies can be killed by the Hot Cannon (left).
	If you hit the enemy with the wrong cannon, the enemy will become stronger, greater, and faster.

			<description>There are some unique gameplay elements in this game and we definitely need more entry like this. I think that's the lesson #1 for game jams: make new stuff from old pre-existing materials. It's a good way to get something good in that short ammount of time !</description>

			<description>Besides the “dual ammo” that rewards careful aim, the enemy inflation mechanic (where larger enemies break more bricks) was quite nice! Developing a complete *in three hours* is way beyond me.</description>
