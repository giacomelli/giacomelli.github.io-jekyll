			<description>The visual style of your game is so neat and striking! I love the sort of menace there is in the way the enemies creep slowly closer to the color you must keep alive. The lines tracking who is going to move where, and the way everything curves, is very neat.

The concept is really interesting, and you made a great game based on it. The audio cues also work well. Great job!</description>

			<description>This game was really crisp on the visuals! The 3D effect was nice! Audio was decent and the gameplay made me think for a second, it intrigued my brain like a good puzzle game should! </description>
