	<description>	
	A GameBoy classic kind of game where you try to complete the quote "I need a doctor" as fast as you can while the board changes the current letter.

	The goal is to complete the quote before losing all the 3 lives.

			<description>Fun twist to a crossword style game. Love all the sound effects. It definitely started to get tricky towards the end to get all the letters! Great game :)</description>
